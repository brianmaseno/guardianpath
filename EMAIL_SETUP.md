```

## What Emergency Emails Include

âœ… **Person's exact location** (address + coordinates)  
âœ… **Google Maps link** for instant navigation  
âœ… **Nearby hospitals and police stations**  
âœ… **AI scene analysis** (if photo captured)  
âœ… **Timestamp and alert ID**  
âœ… **Recommended emergency actions**  

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing credentials for PLAIN" Error
- Make sure `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are set in `.env.local`
- For Gmail, use an **App Password**, not your regular password
- Restart your development server after adding credentials

### Emails Not Sending
- Check your email provider's SMTP settings
- Verify 2-factor authentication is enabled (for Gmail)
- Check the server console for detailed error messages

### Still Not Working?
- The system will **simulate emails** in the console if credentials are missing
- You'll see `ðŸ“§ [SIMULATED EMAIL]` messages with the full content
- This is perfect for development and testing

**ðŸš¨ Important**: Keep your `.env.local` file secure and never commit it to version control!
